    "# Evolutionary computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting off with some hypothesis, as in most machine learning methods (trees, hyperplanes, ...), we establish a set of rules inspired by nature and let the evolution process establish the best method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A population of individuals compete for limited resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individuals die and are born (**dynamic population**)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Survival of the fittest\n",
    "\n",
    "* Characters inheritance from parents to offspring\n",
    "\n",
    "An **individual** has a **phenotype**, which is the characters that can make him fit for the solution to a problem (a set of parameters, a picture) and a **genotype** which is the internal representation of those characters  as a data structure of any kind. The terminology is inspired by biology to resemble nature and allow reuse through common **genotype-phenotype mappings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is dynamic, the population is ruled by a **generational model** which dictates how and when individuals are replaced since population size is fixed. The flow of time is determined by births/deaths and the phenotype and its correspondent fitness are immediately known given the genotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generational model is said to be **non-overlapping** if all parents in the population die at each generation, producing an offspring which is larger than population size, to be filtered after. Else, in an **overlapping model** the parents are added to the offspring and the survivors are chosen between the common pool formed this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generation** occurs each $m$ births, where $m$ is the population size. This allows to compensate different degrees of dynamicity (i.e. systems in which all individuals are replaced at each timestep are more dynamic than those who change only one individual at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many selection criterions for individuals, which differ on their preferrence between fit vs unfit individuals. Those techniques can be applied both for **reproduction** and **survival**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fitness-proportional selection:** Based on phenotype, we compute the fitness for each individual and randomly pick individuals with probabilities proportional to their fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rank-proportional selection:** We rank individuals based on their fitness and randomly pick with probabilities based on rank. This can be applied to non-numerical fitness in theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uniform selection:** Pick randomly individuals (uniform probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Truncation selection:** Pick only the m best individuals (elitism)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tournament selection:** Pick randomly $n_{size}$ individuals with uniform probability and choose the one with best fitness among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If selection has **strong preference** (truncation, tournament with large $n_{size}$), the population converges to fittest individuals rapidly, **exploiting** most promising solutions with the risk of falling into local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "If selection has **weak preference** (uniform selection, tournament with low $n_{size}$) the population includes unfit individuals, and it **explores** many different solutions, possibly without a real convergence towards a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly referred to as the **Exploration/Exploitation trade-off**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build offspring, we can apply a **unary (mutation, on 1 parent)** or **binary (crossover, 2 parents) genetic operator** on parent genotypes. Those operators can be used together **deterministically** (on a fixed number of individuals based on weights of proportion between the two operators) or **stochastically**Â (choosing between the operators randomly with probabilities determined by the same weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation is generally based on probability $p = 0.01$. On trees, it consists in replacing a random subtree with a randomly generated subtree. **Mutation embodies exploitation**, since it consists of fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossover on trees builds trees based on branches of their parents. **Crossover embodies exploration**, since the offspring is much less likely to have better performances than a mutated one. Some types of crossover used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **N-points Crossover**: Choose randomly n **cut points** in the strings representing genotypes of parents (they have to be same size!) and interlace them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uniform Crossover:** A cut point is placed at each index with $p = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Crossover with variable-length genotype**: Cut points may be placed in different points, and child genotype can be larger or smaller than parents size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population initialization can be random or use specific appraoches based on genotype form. The **fitness** is the ability of an individual to solve a problem of interest. It generally consists of one or more numerical indexes. If many fitness functions are present, the system is said to be **multiobjective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common ways to compare multiobjective individuals are **linearization** of their objectives, by establishing a **lexicographical order** of importance for the functions and **Pareto dominance**, which creates fronts of undominated solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some challenges related with EU:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diversity** between individuals in the original population is very important to avoid premature exploitation towards a local minimum. Possible visualisation: **Diversity-usage map (DU Map)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variational inheritance** should also be balanced in order to avoid too similar offspring (high exploitation) or random walks (high exploration).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expressiveness** of phenotype should be balanced since low expressiveness leads to genotypes that aren't reachable, and large expressiveness leads to large convergence time since the search space is larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic algorithms (GA)** are the most widely studied variant of EC, with the following specifics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genotype = Phenotype = bits strings encoding numerical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* m = n = 1000, no overlapping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fitness-proportional selection, or multiobjective Pareto-based selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic programming (GP)** is a variant of genetic algorithms where individuals are programs. The genotype is usally a tree or list of instructions. There is overlapping, with tournament selection. In this context, syntactic and semantic validity are also to be taken in account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grammatical Evolution (GE)** is a GP based on GA, where a **context-free grammar $G$** is given in order to ensure syntactic validity.\n",
