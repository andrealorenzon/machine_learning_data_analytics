<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> What is R?</h3>
<ul>
<li>R is a statistical programming language</li>
<li>R is a free/libre and open-source software, freely and openly distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</li>
<li>The base version of R that you download when you install R includes 
the core code, but you can also install adds-on (“packages”) that people
 all over the world have developed to extend R.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>R is becoming more and more useful for a variety of programming 
tasks. However, where it really shines is in working with data and doing
 statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Other programming languages popular for statistical computing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SAS</li>
<li>SPSS</li>
<li>Matlab</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>R has some of the same strengths (quick and easy to code, interfaces 
well with other languages, easy to work interactively) and weaknesses 
(slower than compiled languages) as Python.</p>
<p>For data-related tasks, R and Python are fairly neck-and-neck.</p>
<p>However, R is still the first choice of statisticians in most fields,
 so it may be argued that R has a an advantage if you want to have 
access to cutting-edge statistical methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best thing about R is that it was developed by statisticians. 
The worst thing about R is that… it was developed by statisticians.” -Bo
 Cowgill, Google, at the Bay Area R Users Group</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Open-source software</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life is too short to run proprietary software.” – Bdale Garbee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>R is open-source software. Many other popular statistical programming languages, conversely, are proprietary.</p>
<p>R is free, and it’s tempting to think of open-source software just as “free software”.</p>
<p>It helps to consider some different meanings of the word “free”. “Free” can mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gratis</em>: Free as in beer</li>
<li><em>Libre</em>: Free as in speech</li>
</ul>

Figure 1.1: An overview of how software can be each type of free. For 
software programs developed using a compiled programming language, the 
final product on your computer is run by machine-readable binary code. A
 developer can give you this code for free without sharing any of the

which you have access to the human-readable code that was used as in 
input in creating the software binaries.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>Open-source software software is the <em>libre</em> type of free (Figure <a href="#fig:open-source-overview">1.1</a>). This means that, with software that is open-source, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access all of the code that makes up the software</li>
<li>Change the code as you’d like for your own applications</li>
<li>Build on the code with your own extensions</li>
<li>Share the software and its code, as well as your extensions, with others</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It also means that you can build your own software on top of existing R software and its extensions.</p>
<p>This open-source nature of R (and other languages, including Python) 
has created a large community of people worldwide who develop and share 
extensions to R.</p>
<p>As a result, you can pull in packages that let you do all kinds of 
things in R, like visualizing Tweets, cleaning up accelerometer data, 
analyzing complex surveys, fitting maching learning models, and a wealth
 of other cool things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Despite its name, open-source software is less vulnerable to hacking
 than the secret, black box systems like those being used in polling 
places now. That’s because anyone can see how open-source systems 
operate. Bugs can be spotted and remedied, deterring those who would 
attempt attacks. This makes them much more secure than closed-source 
models like Microsoft’s, which only Microsoft employees can get into to 
fix.” – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html?mcubz=3">Woolsey and Fox. <em>To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software.</em> New York Times. August 3, 2017.</a></p>

<p>You can download the latest version of R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to select the distribution for your type of computer system. Check your current R version (one way is by running <code>sessionInfo()</code>) to make sure you’re not using an outdated version of R.</p>

<div id="installing-from-cran" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Installing from CRAN</h3>
<p>The most popular place from which to get packages is currently CRAN, which has over 10,000 R packages available.</p>
<p>The <code>ggplot2</code> package for creating beutiful graphs. Since this package is on CRAN, you can install it to your computer using the <code>install.packages</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">"ggplot2"</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>This downloads the package from CRAN and saves it in a special 
location on your computer where R can load it when you’re ready to use 
it.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="loading-an-installed-package" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Loading an installed package</h3>
<p>Once you have installed a package, it will be saved to your computer.</p>
<p>However, you won’t be able to access its functions within an R session until you load it in that R session.</p>
<p>Loading a package essentially makes all of the package’s functions available to you.</p>
<p>You can load a package in an R session using the <code>library</code> function, with the package name inside the parentheses.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(ggplot2)</code></pre></div>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="package-vignettes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Package vignettes</h3>
<p>Many packages will come with a “vignette”, or a tutorial on how to use the package.</p>
<p>To get a list of all the vignettes a package has, use the <code>vignette</code> function, specifying a package name with <code>package</code> option:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">vignette</span>(<span class="dt">package =</span> <span class="st">"ggplot2"</span>)</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>To open a vignette, you can also use the <code>vignette</code> function. For example, to open the vignette called “extending-ggplot2” for the <code>ggplot2</code> package, run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">vignette</span>(<span class="st">"extending-ggplot2"</span>, <span class="dt">package =</span> <span class="st">"ggplot2"</span>)</code></pre></div>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> R’s MVP: The <em>gets arrow</em></h3>
<!-- Most Valuable Player -->
<p>The <em>gets arrow</em>, <code>&lt;-</code>, is R’s assignment operator. It takes whatever you’ve created on the right hand side of the <code>&lt;-</code> and saves it as an object with the name you put on the left hand side.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Note: Generic code
[name of object] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>[thing I want to save]</code></pre></div>
<p>In R, objects are the way to save something to use again later. If 
you do not assign something to an object, R will just print it back out 
to you. For example, just type <code>"Hello"</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="st">"Hello"</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "Hello"</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>However, if I assign <code>"Hello"</code> to an object, I can print it out or use it later by typing (“referencing”) that object name:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">word &lt;-<span class="st"> "Hello"</span>
word
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "Hello"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can assign the output of a function call directly to an object. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">n &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nchar</span>(word)
n
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 5</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>If you would like to see all the R objects that are currently defined in your R session, you can do that with the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">ls</span>()
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "n"         "proj_path" "word"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also check out the “Environment” pane in RStudio to see some of the R objects defined in your current R session.</p>

<div id="assignment-operator-wars---vs." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Assignment operator wars: <code>&lt;-</code> vs. <code>=</code></h3>
<p>You can make assignments in R using either the gets arrow (<code>&lt;-</code>) or <code>=</code>.</p>
<p>R gurus advise using <code>&lt;-</code> rather than <code>=</code> when coding in R, and as you move to doing more complex things, some subtle problems might crop up if you use <code>=</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Naming objects</h3>
<p>When you assign objects, you will need to choose names for them.</p>
<p>There are only two fixed rules for naming objects in R:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use only letters, numbers, and underscores</li>
<li>Don’t start with anything but a letter</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these fixed rules, there are also some guidelines for naming objects. From <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">Hadley Wickham’s R style guide</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use lower case for variable names</li>
<li>Use an underscore as a separator</li>
<li>Avoid using names that are already defined in R</li>
</ul>

<div id="rs-most-basic-object-types" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> R’s most basic object types</h2>
<p>An R <em>object</em> stores some type of data that you want to use later in your R code.</p>
<p>The content of R objects can vary from very simple (the <code>"Hello"</code> string in the example above) to very complex objects (for example, a machine learning model).</p>
<p>There are a variety of different object types in R, shaped to fit different types of objects.</p>
<p>The most basic types of objects are <strong>vectors</strong> (1D) and <strong>dataframes</strong> (2D).</p>
<hr>
<div id="vectors" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Vectors</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <em>vector</em> is a string of values.</li>
<li>All values in a vector must be of the same class (i.e., all numbers, all characters, all dates).</li>
<li>You can use the concatenation function, <code>c</code> to join values together, with commas between the values.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <!-- to create a vector with the first five elements of the Fibonacci sequence, you can run: --></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fibonacci &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>)

one_to_five
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "one"   "two"   "three" "four"  "five"</span></code></pre></div>

mixed_classes
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "1"    "3"    "five"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use the <code>class</code> function to figure out the class of a vector.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">class</span>(fibonacci)
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] "numeric"</span>

<p>A vector’s <em>length</em> is the number of elements in the vector. You can use the <code>length</code> function to determine a vector’s length:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">length</span>(mixed_classes)
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 3</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>You can pull out certain values from a vector by using indexing with square brackets (<code>[...]</code>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fibonacci[<span class="dv">2</span>] <span class="co"># Get the second value</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1</span>
fibonacci[<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>)] <span class="co"># Get first and fifth values</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1 5</span>
fibonacci[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>] <span class="co"># Get the first three values</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1 1 2</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>You can also use logic to pull out some values of a vector. For example, you might only want to pull out even values from the <code>fibonacci</code> vector (make for exercise!).</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># What is the code to pull out even values from the `fibonacci` vector?</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 2</span>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Dataframes</h3>
<p>A dataframe is a 2D, and is made of one or more vectors of the same 
length (although they don’t have to be the same class). It is the 
closest R has to an Excel spreadsheet-type structure.</p>
<p>You can create dataframes using the <code>data.frame</code> function. However, most often you will create a dataframe by reading in data from a file, using something like <code>read.csv</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>To create a dataframe using <code>data.frame</code>, in this case by sticking together vectors you already have saved as R objects, you can run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fibonacci_seq &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>(<span class="dt">num_in_seq =</span> one_to_five,
                            <span class="dt">fibonacci_num =</span> fibonacci)
fibonacci_seq
<span class="co">#&gt;   num_in_seq fibonacci_num</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 1        one             1</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 2        two             1</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 3      three             2</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 4       four             3</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 5       five             5</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>The general format for using <code>data.frame</code> is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Note: Generic code
[name of object] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>([1st column name] =<span class="st"> </span>[1st column content],
                               [2nd column name] =<span class="st"> </span>[2nd column content])</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>You can use square-bracket indexing (<code>[..., ...]</code>) for 
dataframes, too, but now they’ll have two dimensions (rows, then 
columns). Put the rows you want before the comma, the columns after. If 
you want all of something, leave the designated spot blank. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fibonacci_seq[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>] <span class="co"># First two rows, second column</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1 1</span>
fibonacci_seq[<span class="dv">5</span>, ] <span class="co"># Last row, all columns</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;   num_in_seq fibonacci_num</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 5       five             5</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>So far, we’ve only shown how to create dataframes from scratch within
 an R session. Usually, however, you’ll create R dataframes by reading 
in data from an outside file. For example, if you have data on all the 
guests that came on the <em>Daily Show</em> with Jon Stewart (from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/">538 blog</a>) in a comma-separated (csv) file called “daily_show_guests.csv”, you can read it with the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">daily_show &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>...</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">daily_show[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">2</span>, ]
<span class="co">#&gt;   YEAR GoogleKnowlege_Occupation    Show  Group  Raw_Guest_List</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 1 1999                     actor 1/11/99 Acting  Michael J. Fox</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 2 1999                  Comedian 1/12/99 Comedy Sandra Bernhard</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>You can use the functions <code>dim</code>, <code>nrow</code>, and <code>ncol</code> to figure out the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of a dataframe:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">dim</span>(daily_show)
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 2693    5</span>
<span class="kw">nrow</span>(daily_show)
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 2693</span>
<span class="kw">ncol</span>(daily_show)
<span class="co">#&gt; [1] 5</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>Base R also has some useful functions for quickly exploring dataframes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>str</code>: show the structure of an R object,</li>
<li><code>summary</code>: give summaries of each column of a dataframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">summary</span>(daily_show[ , <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)])

<!-- ## Using R functions -->
<!-- ### Function structure -->
<!-- In general, functions in R take the following structure: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- ## Generic code -->
<!-- function.name(parameter 1 = argument 1, parameter 2 = argument 2, -->
<!--               parameter 3 = argument 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The result of the function will be output to your R session, unless you choose to save the output in an object: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- ## Generic code -->
<!-- new_object <- function.name(parameter 1 = argument 1, -->
<!--                             parameter 2 = argument 2, -->
<!--                             parameter 3 = argument 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Here are some example function calls, to give you examples of this structure: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- head(daily_show) -->
<!-- head(daily_show, n = 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- daily_show <- read.csv("data/daily_show_guests.csv", -->
<!--                     skip = 4, -->
<!--                     header = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- daily_show <- read.csv("daily_show_guests.csv", -->
<!--                     skip = 4, -->
<!--                     header = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Within the function call, *parameters* allow you to customize the function to run in a certain way (e.g., use a certain dataframe as an input, give output in a certain format). Some function parameters will have *default arguments*, which means that you don't have to put a value for that parameter for the function to run, but you can if you want the function to do something other than the default. -->
<!-- ### Function help files -->
<!-- You can find out more about a function, include what parameters it has and what the default values, if any, are by using `?` before the function name in the R console. For example, to find out more about the `read.csv` command, run: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- ?read.csv -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- From the "Usage" section of the help file, you can figure out that the only required parameter is `file`, the pathname of the file that you want to read in, since this is the only argument in the "Usage" example without an argument value: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"", -->
<!--          dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You can also see from this "Usage" section that the default value of `header` is `TRUE`, the default value of `sep` is a comma, etc. -->
<!-- The "Arguments" section explains each of the parameters, and possible arguments that each can take. For example, here is the explanation of the `nrows` parameter in the `read.csv` function: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- integer: the maximum number of rows to read in. Negative and other -->
<!--     invalid values are ignored. -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- From this, you can determine that you should put in a whole number, 1 or higher, and the function will only read in that many lines of the dataframe when you run `read.csv`. -->
<!-- ### Function parameters -->
<!-- Each function parameter has a name (e.g., `nrows`, `header`, `file`). The safest way to call a function in R is to use the structure `parameter name = argument value` for every parameter, like this: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- head(x = daily_show, n = 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- However, you can also give argument values by position. For example, in the `head` function, the first parameter is `x`, the object you want to look at, and the second is `n`, the number of elements you want to include when you look at the object. If you know this, you can call `head` using the shorter call: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- head(daily_show, 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you use position alone, you will have problems if you don't include arguments in exactly the right order. However, if you use parameter names to set each argument, it doesn't matter what order you include arguments when calling a function: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # These two calls return the exact same object -->
<!-- head(x = daily_show, n = 3) -->
<!-- head(n = 3, x = daily_show) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Because code tends to be more robust to errors when you use parameter names to set arguments, we recommend against using position, rather than name, to give arguments when calling functions, at least while you're learning R. It's too easy to forget the exact order and get errors in your code. However, there is one exception-- the first argument to a function is almost always required (i.e., there's not a default value), and you very quickly learn what the first parameter of most functions are as soon as you start using the function regularly. Therefore, it's fine to use position alone to specify the first argument in a function, but for now always use the parameter name to set any later arguments: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- head(daily_show, n = 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{block, type='rmdtip'} -->
<!-- Using the full parameter names for arguments can take a bit more time, since it requires more typing. However, RStudio helps you out with that by offering *code completion*. Once you start typing the first few letters of a parameter name within a function call, try pressing the tab key. All possible arguments that start with those letters should show up, and you can scroll through to pick the right one, or keep typing until the argument you want is atnthe top of the list of choices, and then press the tab key again. -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## R scripts -->
<!-- This is a good point in learning R for you to start putting your work in R scripts, rather than entering commands at the console.  -->
<!-- An R script is a plain text file where you can save a series of R commands. You can save the script and open it up later to see (or re-do) what you did earlier, just like you could with something like a Word document when you're writing a paper.  -->
<!-- To open a new R script in RStudio, go to the menu bar and select "File" -> "New File" -> "R Script". Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-N. Figure \@ref(fig:rscript) gives an example of an R script file opened in RStudio and points out some interesting elements. -->
<!-- ```{r rscript, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Example of an R script in RStudio.", out.width= "600pt"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/ExampleOfRScript.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- To save a script you're working on, you can click on the "Save" button (which looks like a floppy disk) at the top of your R script window in RStudio or use the keyboard shortcut Command-S. You should save R scripts using a ".R" file extension. -->
<!-- Within the R script, you'll usually want to type your code so there's one command per line. If your command runs long, you can write a single call over multiple lines. It's unusual to put more than one command on a single line of a script file, but you can if you separate the commands with semicolons (`;`). These rules all correspond to how you can enter commands at the console.  -->
<!-- Running R code from a script file is very easy in RStudio. You can use either the "Run" button or Command-Return, and any code that is selected (i.e., that you've highlighted with your cursor) will run at the console. You can use this functionality to run a single line of code, multiple lines of code, or even just part of a specific line of code. If no code is highlighted, then R will instead run all the code on the line with the cursor and then move the cursor down to the next line in the script.  -->
<!-- You can also run all of the code in a script. To do this, use the "Source" button at the top of the script window. You can also run the entire script either from the console or from within another script by using the `source()` function, with the filename of the script you want to run as the argument. For example, to run all of the code in a file named "MyFile.R" that is saved in your current working directory, run: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- source("MyFile.R") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You can add comments into an R script to let others know (and remind yourself) what you're doing and why. To do this, use R's comment character, `#`. Any line on a script line that starts with `#` will not be read by R. You can also take advantage of commenting to comment out certain parts of code that you don't want to run at the moment. -->
<!-- While it's generally best to write your R code in a script and run it from there rather than entering it interactively at the R console, there are some exceptions. A main example is when you're initially checking out a dataset, to make sure you've read it in correctly. It often makes more sense to run commands for this task, like `str()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `summary()`, at the console. These are all examples of commands where you're trying to look at something about your data **right now**, rather than code that builds toward your analysis, or helps you read in or clean up your data.   -->
<!-- ### Commenting code -->
<!-- Sometimes, you'll want to include notes in your code. You can do this in all programming languages by using a *comment character* to start the line with your comment. In R, the comment character is the hash symbol, `#`. R will skip any line that starts with `#` in a script. For example, if you run the following code:  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Don't print this. -->
<!-- "But print this" -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- R will only print the second, uncommented line.  -->
<!-- You can also use a comment in the middle of a line, to add a note on what you're doing in that line of the code. R will skip any part of the code from the hash symbol on. For example:  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- "Print this" ## But not this, it's a comment. -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- There's typically no reason to use code comments when running commands at the R console. However, it's very important to get in the practice of including meaningful comments in R scripts. This helps you remember what you did when you revisit your code later.  -->

<!-- ### About the dataset -->
<!-- For today's class, you'll be using a dataset of all the guests on *The Daily Show* when Jon Stewart was the host. This data was originally collected by Nate Silver's website, [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) and is available on [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub page](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/daily-show-guests) under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). I have copied this data into my GitHub repository for this class. The only change made to the original file was to add (commented) attribution information at the start of the file. -->
<!-- **First, check out a bit more about this data and its source:** -->
<!-- * Check out [the Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). What are we allowed to do with this data? What restrictions are there on using the data? -->
<!-- * It's often helpful to use prior knowledge to help check out or validate your dataset. One thing we might want to know about this data is if it covers the whole time that Jon Stewart hosted *The Daily Show*. Use Google to find out the dates he started and finished as host. -->
<!-- * Briefly browse around [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub data page](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). What are some other datasets available that you find interesting?

We'll talk more about GitHub later, but you might find it interesting to explore a bit now. It's a place where people can post, work on, and share code in a number of programming languages-- it's been referred to as "Facebook for Nerds".

<!-- ### Manually creating vectors and a dataframe -->
<!-- Start by manually creating some vectors and data frames with a small subset of this data. -->
<!-- * Use the concatenate function (`c`) to create a vector "from scratch" with the names of the five guests to appear on the show (these could be the first five guests, or you could also randomly pick five guests). Assign this vector to an object named `five_guests`. What class (numeric or character) do you think this vector will be? Will you need to use quotation marks for each element you add to the vector? -->
<!-- * Use square bracket indexing to print out the following subsets of this vector (you'll have one R call per subset): (1) The first guest in the vector; (2) The third and fifth guests; (3) The second through fourth guests. -->
<!-- * Create a new vector called `first_guest` with just the first set, using the square bracket indexing you used in the previous step.  -->
<!-- * In the same way, create a vector with the year of each of these guests' appearances. Assign this vector to an object named `appearance_year`. What class (numeric or character) do you think this vector will be? Will you need to use quotation marks for each element you add to the vector? -->
<!-- * Use the `class` function to determine the classes (e.g., numeric, character) of each of the vectors you just created. -->
<!-- * Combine these two vectors to create a dataframe named `guest_list`. For the columns, use the same column names used in the original, raw data for the guest names and appearance year. Print out this dataframe at the R console to make sure it looks like you thought it would. -->
<!-- * Use square bracket indexing to print out the following subsets of this dataframe (you'll have one R call per subset): (1) The appearance year of the first guest; (2) Names of the third through fifth guests; (3) Names of all guests; (4) Both names and appearance years of the first and third guests. -->
<!-- * The `str` function can be used to figure out the structure of a dataframe. Run this command on the `guest_list` dataframe you created. What information does this give you? Use the helpfile for `str` to help you figure this out (which you can access by running `?str`). Do you see anything that surprises you? -->
<!-- * Use the `ls` function to list all the objects you currently have defined in your R session. Compare this list to the "Environment" pane in RStudio. -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # I picked five random guests from throughout the dataset. The guests you pick will  -->
<!-- # likely be different. -->
<!-- # Create a vector with the names of five guests -->
<!-- five_guests <- c("Miss Piggy", "Stanley Tucci", "Kermit the Frog", -->
<!--                  "Hank Azaria", "Al Gore") -->
<!-- # Use square-bracket indexing to print out some subsets of the data -->
<!-- five_guests[1] -->
<!-- five_guests[c(3, 5)] -->
<!-- five_guests[2:4] -->
<!-- # Save just the first guest in a separate object -->
<!-- first_guest <- five_guests[1] -->
<!-- first_guest -->
<!-- # Create a vector with the year of the appearance of each guest -->
<!-- appearance_year <- c(1999, 2000, 2001, 2001, 2002) -->
<!-- # Figure out the classes of the two vectors you just created -->
<!-- class(five_guests) -->
<!-- class(appearance_year) -->
<!-- # Create the data frame, then print it out to make sure it looks like you thought -->
<!-- # it would -->
<!-- guest_list <- data.frame(Raw_Guest_List = five_guests, -->
<!--                          YEAR = appearance_year) -->
<!-- guest_list -->
<!-- # Use square bracket indexing to print subsets of the data frame -->
<!-- guest_list[1, 2] -->
<!-- guest_list[3:5, 1] -->
<!-- guest_list[ , 1] -->
<!-- guest_list[c(1, 3), ] -->
<!-- # Use `str` to check out the structure of the data frame you created -->
<!-- str(guest_list) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Installing and using a package -->
<!-- The `stringr` package includes a number of functions that make it easier to work with character strings in R. In particular, it includes functions to change the capitalization of words in character stings. Here, you'll install and load this package and then use it to work with the `five_guests` vector we created in the last section.  -->
<!-- * If you have not already installed the `stringr` package, install it from CRAN. -->
<!-- * Load the `stringr` package in your current R session, so you will be able to use its functions.  -->
<!-- * Check if the package has a vignette. If so, check out out that vignette.  -->
<!-- * See if you can use the `str_to_lower` function from the `stringr` package to convert all the names in your `five_guests` vector to lowercase.  -->
<!-- * See if you can find a function in the `stringr` package that you can use to convert all the names in your `five_guests` vector to uppercase. (Hint: At the R console, try typing `?stringr::` and then the Tab key.) -->
<!-- Example R code:  -->
<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # If you need to, install the package from CRAN -->
<!-- install.packages("stringr") -->
<!-- # Load the package into your current R session -->
<!-- library(stringr) -->
<!-- # Open the package's vignette -->
<!-- vignette("stringr") -->
<!-- # Convert the `five_guests` strings to lowercase -->
<!-- str_to_lower(five_guests) -->
<!-- # Convert the `five_guests` strings to uppercase -->
<!-- str_to_upper(five_guests) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Getting the data onto your computer -->
<!-- Next, we will work with the whole dataset. Download the data from GitHub onto your computer. Make a directory (folder) on your computer specifically for this course (I strongly recommend that you put it somewhere where the file path will not have any spaces in it-- for example, putting it in your home directory, under the name "R_Prog_Course" would be great. Putting it in a directory called "R Prog Course" would not.). Put the *Daily Show* data in your directory for this course.  -->
<!-- **Take the following steps to get the data onto your computer** -->
<!-- * Find out what your home directory is in R. To do this, make sure R is set to your home directory using `setwd("~")`, and then get R to print that home directory path using `getwd()`. -->
<!-- * If you do not yet have a directory (folder) just for this course, make one someplace straightforward like in your home directory. Do not use any spaces in the directory name. -->
<!-- * Download the file [from GitHub](https://github.com/geanders/RProgrammingForResearch/blob/master/data/daily_show_guests.csv). Right click on `Raw` and then choose "Download linked file". Put the file into the directory you created for this course.  -->
<!-- * Outside of R, open Finder (for Macs), Windows Explorer (for Windows), or your system's equivalent. Go to your home directory (mine, for example, is `/Users/brookeanderson`). Figure out how to get from your home directory to the directory you created for this course. If you create the course directory as a subdirectory in your home directory, this will just be one step from your home directory.  -->
<!-- * Go back into R. Set R's working directory to your directory for this class using the `setwd` command, now that you know the pathname for the directory. For example, I would use `setwd("~/RProgrammingForResearch/data")`.  -->
<!-- * Use the `list.files` command to make sure that the "daily_show_guests.csv" file is in your current working directory. -->
<!-- The full R code for this task might look something like: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Set the working directory to your home directory -->
<!-- setwd("~") -->
<!-- # Print out the current working directory -->
<!-- getwd() -->
<!-- # Example code to re-set the working directory to your course directory -->
<!-- setwd("~/RProgrammingForResearch") -->
<!-- # List the files in your current working directory -->
<!-- list.files() -->
<!-- "daily_show_guests.csv" %in% list.files() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you have extra time: -->
<!-- * See if you can figure out the last line of code in the example R code. -->
<!-- ### Getting the data into R -->
<!-- Now that you have the dataset in your working directory, you can read it into R. This dataset is in a *csv* (comma separated values) format. (We will talk more about different file formats next week.) You can read csv files into R using the `read.csv` function.  -->
<!-- **Read the data into your R session** -->
<!-- * Use the `read.csv` function to read the data into R and save it as the object `daily_show`. -->
<!-- * Use the help file for the `read.csv` function to figure out how this function works. To pull that up, type `?read.csv` at the R console. Why are we using the option `header = TRUE`? Can you figure out why we're using the `skip` option, and why it's set to 4? -->
<!-- * Note that you need to put the file name in quotation marks. -->
<!-- * What would have happened if you'd used `read.csv` but hadn't saved the result as the object `daily_show`? (For example, you'd run the code `read.csv("daily_show_guests.csv")` rather than `daily_show <- read.csv("daily_show_guests.csv")`.) -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Read in dataframe from the csv file with Daily Show guests -->
<!-- daily_show <- read.csv("daily_show_guests.csv", header = TRUE, skip = 4) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you have extra time: -->
<!-- * Say this was a really big dataset. You want to check out just the first 10 rows to make sure that you've got your code right before you take the time to pull in the whole dataset. Use the help file for `read.csv` to figure out how to only read in a few rows.  -->
<!-- * Look through the help file for other options available for `read.csv`. Can you think of examples when some of these options would be useful? -->
<!-- * Look again at the version of this raw data on FiveThirtyEight's GitHub page (rather than the course's GitHub repository, where you downloaded the data for the course exercise). How are these two versions of the raw data different? How would you need to change your `read.csv` call if you changed to use the FiveThirtyEight version of the raw data? -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Read in only the first 10 rows of the dataset -->
<!-- daily_show_first10 <- read.csv("daily_show_guests.csv", header = TRUE, -->
<!--                        skip = 4, nrows = 10) -->
<!-- daily_show_first10 -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Checking out the data -->
<!-- You now have the data available in your current R session as the `daily_show` object. You'll want to check it out to make sure it read in correctly, and also to get a feel for the data. Throughout, you can use the help pages to figure out more about any of the functions being used (for example, `?dim`). -->
<!-- **Take the following steps to check out the dataset** -->
<!-- * Use the `dim` function to find out how many rows and columns this dataframe has. Based on what you found out about the data from the GitHub page, does it have the number of columns you expected? Based on what you know about the data (all the guests who came on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart), do you think it has about the right number of rows? -->
<!-- * Use indexing to look at the first two rows of the dataset. Based on this, what does each row "measure"? What information do you get for each "measurement"? As a reminder, indexing uses square brackets immediately after the object name. If the object has two dimensions, like a dataframe (rows and columns), you put the rows you want, then a comma, then the columns you want. If you want all rows (or columns), you leave that space blank. For example, if you wanted to get the first two rows and the first three columns, you'd use `daily_show[1:2, 1:3]`. If you wanted to get the first five rows and all the columns, you'd use `daily_show[1:5, ]`.  -->
<!-- * Use the `head` function to look at the first few rows of the dataframe. Does it look like the rows go in order by date? What was the date of Jon Stewart's first show? Does it look like this dataset covers that first show? -->
<!-- * Use the `tail` function to look at the last few rows of the dataframe. What is the last show date covered by the dataframe? Who was the last guest? -->
<!-- * Use the `str` function to get more details about the `daily_show` dataframe you read in.  -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Use indexing to see a subset of the data -->
<!-- daily_show[1:2, ] -->
<!-- # Check the dimensions of the data -->
<!-- dim(daily_show) -->
<!-- head(daily_show) -->
<!-- tail(daily_show) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you have extra time: -->
<!-- * Say you wanted to look at the first ten rows of the dataframe, rather than the first six. How could you use an option with `head` to do this? -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Look at the first few rows of the data -->
<!-- head(daily_show, n = 10) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Using the data to answer questions -->
<!-- Nate Silver was a guest on *The Daily Show*. Let's use this data to figure out how many times he was a guest and when he was on the show. -->
<!-- **Find out more about Nate Silver on The Daily Show** -->
<!-- * The `subset` function can be combined with logical statements to help you create a specific subset of data. For example, if you only wanted data from guest visits in 1999, you could run `subset(daily_show, YEAR == 1999)`. Check out the helpfile for `subset` and use the function to create a new dataframe that only has the rows of `daily_show` when Nate Silve was a guest. Put it in the object `nate_silver`. -->
<!-- * Print out the full `nate_silver` dataframe by typing `nate_silver`. (You could just use this to answer both questions, but still try the next steps. They would be important with a bigger dataset.) -->
<!-- * To count the number of times Nate Silver was a guest, you'll need to count the number of rows in the new dataset. You can either use the `dim` function or the `nrow` function to do this. What additional information does the `dim` function give you? -->
<!-- * To get the dates when Nate Silver was a guest, you can print out just the `Show` column of the dataframe. There are a few ways you can do this using indexing: `nate_silver[ , 3]` (since `Show` is the third column), `nate_silver[ , "Show"]`, or `nate_silver$Show`. Try these. -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Create a subset of the data with just Nate Silver appearances -->
<!-- nate_silver <- subset(daily_show,  -->
<!--                       Raw_Guest_List == "Nate Silver") -->
<!-- # Investigate this subset of the data -->
<!-- nate_silver -->
<!-- dim(nate_silver) -->
<!-- nrow(nate_silver) -->
<!-- nate_silver[ , 3] -->
<!-- nate_silver[ , "Show"] -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you have extra time: -->
<!-- * When you print out the `Show` column, why does it also print out something underneath about Levels? Hint: This has to do with the class that R has saved this column as. What class is it currently? What other classes might we want to consider converting it to as we continue working with the dataset? Check out the example code below to get some ideas. -->
<!-- * Was Nate Silver the only statistician to be a guest on the show? -->
<!-- * What were the occupations that were only represented by one guest visit? Since `GoogleKnowlege_Occupation` is a factor, you can use the `table` function to create a new vector with the number of times each value of `GoogleKnowlege_Occupation` shows up. You can put this information into a new vector and then pull out only the values that equal 1 (so, only had one guest). (Note that "Statistician" doesn't show up-- there was only one person who was a guest, but he had three visits.) Pick your favorite "one-off" example and find out who the guest was for that occupation. -->
<!-- Example R code: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- class(nate_silver$Show) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- range(nate_silver$Show) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- nate_silver$Show <- as.Date(nate_silver$Show, -->
<!--                             format = "%m/%d/%y") -->
<!-- range(nate_silver$Show) -->
<!-- diff(range(nate_silver$Show)) # Time between Nate's first and last shows -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- statisticians <- subset(daily_show, -->
<!--                         GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "Statistician") -->
<!-- statisticians -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- num_visits <- table(daily_show[ , 2]) -->
<!-- head(num_visits) # Note: This is a vector rather than a dataframe -->
<!-- names(num_visits[num_visits == 1]) -->
<!-- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "chess player") -->
<!-- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "mathematician") -->
<!-- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "orca trainer") -->
<!-- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "Puzzle Creator") -->
<!-- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == "Scholar") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### Writing your code as an R script -->
<!-- While the R console is fine for initially exploring data, you should get in the habit of writing up R code in an R script for most of your data analysis projects in R.  -->
<!-- * Open a new R script and save it to your current working directory (i.e., wherever you saved the data you downloaded for this exercise). -->
<!-- * Take some of the code that you wrote for this exercise (including the function to read the data into R). Put it in the R script. Do not put more than one function call per line (but it's fine to have longer function calls span a few lines). -->
<!-- * Use the "Run" button to run a single line of this code. Check the console to see what happens when you do. -->
<!-- * Highlight a few lines of the code and use "Run" to run them. -->
<!-- * Try using the keyboard shortcut (Command-Return) to run the line of code your cursor is currently on. Try doing this with a function call that runs across several lines of the R script file-- what do you see at the console? -->
<!-- * Try running the whole script using "Source". Again, look at the console after you "source" the script.  -->
<!-- * Close your R session (and save any changes to your R script). Do **not** save your R session history. Re-open R and see if you can re-open your R script and re-run it. Try using `ls()` to list the objects in your R session before and after you re-run your script. Does anything about the results surprise you? -->
