    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A model which allows to predict an outcome from a given set of categories given in input is called **supervised learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model which doesn't have any information about the possible subgroups in data and could build those from relationships and structures in data is called **supervised learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spam flagging**: _supervised learning_, since we are giving examples of spam mail to make it easier for the system to recognize spam mails.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image understanding**: _supervised learning_, since image categories should be previously defined. Since often images are missing tags or labels, we can infer the label from captions attached to the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flight trajectories analysis**: _unsupervised learning_, since we just want to cluster on common patterns and trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authoring regular expressions**: _none of the above_, since the learning doesn't happen at the beginning, this is an example of **online learning**.\n",
